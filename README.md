## Overview

A fully static, single-file web application (`index.html`) that helps network security engineers migrate Cisco Secure Firewall (formerly Firepower) local Snort 2 rules to Snort 3 format.  
No backend server required — hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Features

### 1. Home — Rule Converter
Converts Snort 2 local rules to Snort 3 syntax via a **4-pass conversion pipeline**.

#### Conversion Algorithm

**Pass 1 — Option-Level Keyword Transformation**

Each rule is parsed into a header and semicolon-delimited options (quote-aware, escape-aware tokenizer). The following transformations are applied per keyword:

| Snort 2 | Action | Snort 3 Result |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| `uricontent:"X"` | Split into sticky buffer + content | `http_uri; content:"X"` |
| `flowbits:set,name` | Converted to host-tracked xbits | `xbits:set,name,track ip_src` |
| `flowbits:noalert` | Standalone flag conversion | `noalert` |
| `flowbits:reset` | No Snort 3 equivalent | ⚠ removed + WARNING |
| `isdataat:N,rawbytes` | rawbytes sub-option stripped | `isdataat:N` |
| `file_data:mime` | Parameter stripped | `file_data` |
| `fast_pattern:only` | `:only` qualifier removed | `fast_pattern` |
| `metadata:service http` | service entries promoted | `service:http` |
| `sameip` | Renamed | `same_ip` |
| `rawbytes`, `threshold`, `resp`, `react`, `tag`, `activates`, `activated_by`, `logto`, `session`, `stream_reassemble`, `replace` | Removed in Snort 3 | ⚠ removed + WARNING |

**Pass 2 — Sticky Buffer Reordering**

In Snort 3, sticky buffer keywords (`http_uri`, `http_header`, etc.) must appear **before** their associated `content` option. This pass moves any out-of-order sticky buffers to the correct position.

**Pass 3 — PCRE HTTP Flag Conversion**

Snort 2 PCRE uses single-letter HTTP flags (e.g. `/pattern/Ui` for URI). Snort 3 replaces these with sticky buffers placed before the pcre option.

```
pcre:"/pattern/Ui"  →  http_uri; pcre:"/pattern/i"
```

**Pass 4 — Content Modifier Inlining**

In Snort 3, positional modifiers (`depth`, `within`, `offset`, `distance`, `nocase`, `fast_pattern`) must be inlined as comma-separated arguments inside the content option.

```
content:"X"; depth:20; nocase; distance:0;
→ content:"X", depth 20, nocase, distance 0;
```

**Final Steps**
- `gid`, `sid`, `rev` are always sorted to the end of the options in that order
- If a **Start SID** is specified, each rule's SID is remapped sequentially from that value
- Original → new SID mapping is persisted to `localStorage` for cross-session traceability

#### Additional Home Features
- **File drag & drop** — drag a `.rules` file directly onto the input area
- **Side-by-side diff view** — token-level diff highlighting between original and converted rules
- **Rule explanation panel** — per-rule breakdown of action, protocol, network, detection criteria, metadata
- **Download converted rules** — export as `.rules` file with FMC-compatible naming

### 2. Rule Optimization

Analyzes Snort 2 or Snort 3 local rules, provides optimization suggestions in **Korean**, and emits an auto-fixed version of each rule.

- **Version toggle** — Snort 2 / Snort 3 selector applies version-specific checks
- **Multi-line rule support** — parenthesis depth tracking joins formatted multi-line rules before analysis
- **Version mismatch detection** — warns if Snort 3-only keywords appear in a Snort 2 rule (or vice versa)
- **Per-rule suggestions** — categorized as `PERF` (performance), `WARN` (correctness), `INFO` (best practice)
- **Per-option detailed explanation** — `OPT_EXPLAIN` database covers ~40 keywords with Korean descriptions
- **Click to expand** — rule header shows truncated rule, click to reveal full text
- **Auto-fix engine** — `applySnort2Fixes()` / `applySnort3Fixes()` automatically rewrites each rule to follow best practices and lists the changes that were applied
- **All Optimized Rules panel** — top-of-screen aggregated view of every fixed rule with a one-click **Copy All** button (rendered for **both Snort 2 and Snort 3**)
- **Per-rule Optimized Rule section** — each rule card shows its fixed version + auto-fixes list + per-rule Copy button (rendered for **both Snort 2 and Snort 3**)

#### Suggestion Categories (examples)

| Level | Example Check |
|-------|---------------|
| PERF | `pcre` without preceding `content` anchor |
| PERF | Multiple `content` options without `fast_pattern` |
| PERF | Missing `flow` option |
| WARN | Unknown rule action |
| WARN | Missing `msg`, `sid`, `rev` |
| WARN | SID not in local rule range (1,000,000–1,999,999) |
| WARN | Deprecated Snort 2 keywords present |
| INFO | `flowbits` → `xbits` migration note |
| INFO | `dce_stub_data` requires dce2 inspector |

#### Auto-Fix Examples

| Version | Auto-Fix |
|---------|----------|
| Snort 2 / 3 | Inject `fast_pattern` on the longest `content` when missing |
| Snort 2 / 3 | Append `flow:established,to_server;` when `flow` is absent |
| Snort 2 / 3 | Reorder `gid; sid; rev;` to the end of the option list |
| Snort 3 | Convert `uricontent:"X"` → `http_uri; content:"X"` |
| Snort 3 | Convert `flowbits:set,name` → `xbits:set,name,track ip_src` |
| Snort 3 | Strip Snort-2-only modifiers (`rawbytes`, `:only`, `metadata:service http` → `service:http`) |
| Snort 3 | Inline positional content modifiers (`depth`, `within`, `offset`, `distance`, `nocase`, `fast_pattern`) |
| Snort 3 | Promote sticky buffers (`http_uri`, `http_header`, …) before their `content` |

### 3. Python Validator

Generates a standalone Python 3 script (`validate_snort3.py`) for offline Snort 3 rule validation.

- **No dependencies** — pure Python 3, no external packages required
- **Embed converted rules** — load rules converted on the Home tab directly into the script
- **Network variable inputs** — configure `$HOME_NET` / `$EXTERNAL_NET` (Source/Dest IP/CIDR)
- **Apply to Script** — commits network variables into the generated script
- **Download / Copy** — export the script for use in CI/CD pipelines or local validation

---

### 4. Snort SRU Updates

- Fetches all advisory pages for the current week (Sunday–Saturday) in parallel via `Promise.all`
- Source: `snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Filters blocks matching `Snort version 2XXXXXXX` pattern
- Shows **New / Modified / Deleted** rule counts per day with collapsible day blocks

---

### 5. Snort LSP Updates
